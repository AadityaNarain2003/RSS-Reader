<article>Should Friday be the New Saturday?
Abstract of a paper published on National Bureau of Economic Research: This paper investigates self-reported wedges between how much people work and how much they want to work, at their current wage. More than two-thirds of full-time workers in German survey data are overworked -- actual hours exceed desired hours. We combine this evidence with a simple model of labor supply to assess the welfare consequences of tighter weekly hours limits via willingness-to-pay calculations. According to counterfactuals, the optimal length of the workweek in Germany is 37 hours. Introducing such a cap would raise welfare by .8-1.6% of GDP. The gains from a shortened workweek are largest for workers who are married, female, white collar, middle aged, and high income. An extended analysis integrates a non-constant wage-hours relationship, falling capital returns, and a shrinking tax base.<p></p><div>

<article>Heat Can Age You As Much As Smoking, a New Study Finds
Prolonged exposure to extreme heat accelerates biological aging in older adults, increasing the risk of age-related illnesses, according to research published in Science Advances. 

In a nationally representative study of 3,686 U.S. adults over age 56, scientists found that long-term exposure to high heat days was associated with accelerated epigenetic aging - molecular changes that affect how genes function without altering DNA itself. 

Researchers from the University of Southern California discovered that individuals living in areas where heat index values regularly exceed 90F showed signs of being biologically older than those in cooler regions, even after controlling for factors like wealth, education, and lifestyle habits. Six-year cumulative heat exposure linked to as much as 2.48 years of accelerated aging in one measurement.<p></p><div>

<article>HR Tech Firm Rippling Sues Rival Deel for Corporate Espionage
HR software provider Rippling has sued competitor Deel for allegedly planting a spy in its Dublin office to steal trade secrets, court documents [PDF] showed on Monday. Rippling claims the employee, identified as D.S., systematically searched internal Slack channels for competitor information, including sales leads and pitch decks. 

The company discovered the alleged scheme through a &#34;honeypot&#34; trap -- a specially created Slack channel mentioned in a letter to Deel executives. When served with a court order to surrender his phone, D.S. locked himself in a bathroom before fleeing, according to the lawsuit. &#34;We&#39;re all for healthy competition, but we won&#39;t tolerate when a competitor breaks the law,&#34; said Vanessa Wu, Rippling&#39;s general counsel. Both companies operate multibillion-dollar HR platforms, with Rippling valued at $13.5 billion and Deel at over $12 billion.<p></p><div>

<article>FSF&#39;s Memorabilia Silent Auction Begins Today
This week the Free Software Foundation published memorabilia items for an online silent auction — part of their big 40th anniversary celebration. &#34;Starting March 17, the FSF will unlock items each day for bidding on the LibrePlanet wiki at 12:00 EDT.. Bidding on all items will conclude at 15:00 EDT on March 21, 2025... 

&#34;During the auction, the FSF welcomes everyone who supports user freedom to bid on historical and symbolic free software memorabilia,&#34; they annouced this week:

The auction is split into two parts: a silent auction hosted on the LibrePlanet wiki from March 17 through March 21 and a live auction held on the FSF&#39;s Galène videoconferencing server on March 23 from 14:00-17:00. The auction is only the opening act to a months-long itinerary celebrating forty years of free software activism... 

Executive director Zoë Kooyman adds: &#34;These items are valuable pieces of FSF history, and some of them are emblematic of the free software movement. We want to entrust these memorabilia in the hands of the free software community for preservation and would love to see some of these items displayed in exhibitions.&#34; All in all, there are twenty-five pieces that are either directly part of the FSF&#39;s history and/or representative of the free software movement that will be available in the silent auction. 

Winning bidders can rest assured that all proceeds from this auction will go towards the FSF&#39;s continued work to promote computer user freedom worldwide.
 

Silent auction items include:
 A print of the famous Gnu-with-Tux-as-superheroes poster signed by Richard Stallman and artist Lissanne Lake. Bids start at $300...

A mid-1980s VT220 terminal that &#34;still works, and can be connected to your favorite free machine over the serial interface... This is the same terminal that was on the FSF reception desk for some time, introducing visitors to ASCII art, NetHack, and other free software lore.&#34; Bids start at $250... (with estimate shipping costs of $100)

An Amiga 3000UX donated to the GNU project &#34;sometime in 1990.&#34; While it now has a damaged battery, &#34;FSF staff programmers used it at MIT to help further some early development of the GNU operating system.&#34; Starting bid: $300 (with estimated shipping costs of $400).
&#34;A variety of plush animals that had greeted visitors at its former offices in Boston on 51 Franklin Street...&#34;

&#34;The most notable items have been reserved for the live auction on Sunday, March 23,&#34; they note — including the Internet Hall of Fame medal awarded to FSF founder Richard Stallman in 2013 &#34;as ultimate recognition of free software&#39;s immense impact on the development and advancement of the Internet.&#34;<p></p><div>

<article>BlueSky Proposes &#39;New Standard&#39; for When Scraping Data for AI Training
An anonymous reader shared this article from TechCrunch:


Social network Bluesky recently published a proposal on GitHub outlining new options it could give users to indicate whether they want their posts and data to be scraped for things like generative AI training and public archiving. 

CEO Jay Graber discussed the proposal earlier this week, while on-stage at South by Southwest, but it attracted fresh attention on Friday night, after she posted about it on Bluesky. Some users reacted with alarm to the company&#39;s plans, which they saw as a reversal of Bluesky&#39;s previous insistence that it won&#39;t sell user data to advertisers and won&#39;t train AI on user posts.... Graber replied that generative AI companies are &#34;already scraping public data from across the web,&#34; including from Bluesky, since &#34;everything on Bluesky is public like a website is public.&#34; So she said Bluesky is trying to create a &#34;new standard&#34; to govern that scraping, similar to the robots.txt file that websites use to communicate their permissions to web crawlers... 

If a user indicates that they don&#39;t want their data used to train generative AI, the proposal says, &#34;Companies and research teams building AI training sets are expected to respect this intent when they see it, either when scraping websites, or doing bulk transfers using the protocol itself.&#34; 

Over on Threads someone had a different wish for our AI-enabled future. &#34;I want to be able to conversationally chat to my feed algorithm. To be able to explain to it the types of content I want to see, and what I don&#39;t want to see. I want this to be an ongoing conversation as it refines what it shows me, or my interests change.&#34; 

&#34;Yeah I want this too,&#34; posted top Instagram/Threads executive Adam Mosseri, who said he&#39;d talked about the idea with VC Sam Lessin. &#34;There&#39;s a ways to go before we can do this at scale, but I think it&#39;ll happen eventually.&#34;<p></p><div>

<article>Google&#39;s AI &#39;Co-Scientist&#39; Solved a 10-Year Superbug Problem in Two Days
Google collaborated with Imperial College London and its &#34;Fleming Initiative&#34; partnership with Imperial NHS, giving their scientists &#34;access to a powerful new AI designed&#34; built with Gemini 2.0 &#34;to make research faster and more efficient,&#34; according to an announcement from the school. And the results were surprising... 


&#34;José Penadés and his colleagues at Imperial College London spent 10 years figuring out how some superbugs gain resistance to antibiotics,&#34; writes LiveScience. &#34;But when the team gave Google&#39;s &#39;co-scientist&#39;&#39; — an AI tool designed to collaborate with researchers — this question in a short prompt, the AI&#39;s response produced the same answer as their then-unpublished findings in just two days.&#34;

Astonished, Penadés emailed Google to check if they had access to his research. The company responded that it didn&#39;t. The researchers published their findings [about working with Google&#39;s AI] Feb. 19 on the preprint server bioRxiv... 

&#34;What our findings show is that AI has the potential to synthesise all the available evidence and direct us to the most important questions and experimental designs,&#34; co-author Tiago Dias da Costa, a lecturer in bacterial pathogenesis at Imperial College London, said in a statement. &#34;If the system works as well as we hope it could, this could be game-changing; ruling out &#39;dead ends&#39; and effectively enabling us to progress at an extraordinary pace....&#34; 

After two days, the AI returned suggestions, one being what they knew to be the correct answer. &#34;This effectively meant that the algorithm was able to look at the available evidence, analyse the possibilities, ask questions, design experiments and propose the very same hypothesis that we arrived at through years of painstaking scientific research, but in a fraction of the time,&#34; Penadés, a professor of microbiology at Imperial College London, said in the statement. The researchers noted that using the AI from the start wouldn&#39;t have removed the need to conduct experiments but that it would have helped them come up with the hypothesis much sooner, thus saving them years of work. 
Despite these promising findings and others, the use of AI in science remains controversial. A growing body of AI-assisted research, for example, has been shown to be irreproducible or even outright fraudulent.
 

Google has also published the first test results of its AI &#39;co-scientist&#39; system, according to Imperial&#39;s announcement, which adds that academics from a handful of top-universities &#34;asked a question to help them make progress in their field of biomedical research... Google&#39;s AI co-scientist system does not aim to completely automate the scientific process with AI. Instead, it is purpose-built for collaboration to help experts who can converse with the tool in simple natural language, and provide feedback in a variety of ways, including directly supplying their own hypotheses to be tested experimentally by the scientists.&#34; 
Google describes their system as &#34;intended to uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and tailored to specific research objectives... 
&#34;We look forward to responsible exploration of the potential of the AI co-scientist as an assistive tool for scientists,&#34; Google adds, saying the project &#34;illustrates how collaborative and human-centred AI systems might be able to augment human ingenuity and accelerate scientific discovery.<p></p><div>

<article>Consumer Groups Push New Law Fighting &#39;Zombie&#39; IoT Devices
Long-time Slashdot reader chicksdaddy writes:
A group of U.S. consumer advocacy groups on Wednesday proposed legislation to address the growing epidemic of &#34;zombie&#34; Internet of Things (IoT) devices that have had software support cut off by their manufacturer, Fight To Repair News reports. 


The Connected Consumer Product End of Life Disclosure Act is a collaboration between Consumer Reports, US PIRG, the Secure Resilient Future Foundation (SRFF) and the Center for Democracy and Technology. It requires manufacturers of connected consumer products to disclose for how long they will provide technical support, security updates, or bug fixes for the software and hardware that are necessary for the product to operate securely. 

The groups proposed legal requirements that manufacturers &#34;must notify consumers when their devices are nearing the end of life and provide guidance on how to handle the device&#39;s end of life,&#34; while end-of-life notifications &#34;must include details about features that will be lost, and potential vulnerabilities and security risks that may arise.&#34; And when an ISP-provided device (like a router) reaches its end of life, the ISP must remove them. 

&#34;The organizations are working with legislators at the state and federal level to get the model legislation introduced,&#34; according to Fight To Repair News.<p></p><div>

<article>Remote Working Saved Zillow Money, Helped Recruiting, and Maintained Productivity
Zillow CEO Jeremy Wacksman &#34;recently told Entrepreneur magazine that almost five years of remote work has &#39;been fantastic for us,&#39;&#34; writes the Seattle Times.


Zillow shifted to allowing people to work fully remote during the pandemic. It&#39;s been a recruiting and retention tool for Zillow as they &#34;now see four times the number of job applicants for every job we have versus what we did before the pandemic,&#34; Wacksman said. 

While Zillow still lists its corporate headquarters as Seattle, the company bills itself as &#34;cloud-headquartered,&#34; with remote workers and satellite offices. Wacksman&#39;s comments are backed by serious real estate moves the company has made over the past five years. An annual report detailing Zillow&#39;s financial results for 2024 shows its Seattle headquarters and offices across the country are shrinking. In 2019, Zillow had 386,275 square feet of office space in Seattle after steadily gobbling up floors of the Russell Investments Center downtown over the prior five years. The company reported it had 113,470 square feet in Seattle at the end of 2024... The company has drastically cut costs by shedding offices. Zillow&#39;s total leasing costs reached $54 million in 2022 and dropped to $34 million last year... It expects those costs to decrease even further, to $18 million by 2029. Zillow is also taking advantage of subleasing some of its office space and expects $26 million in sublease income between 2025 and 2030... 
Zillow&#39;s financial results from last year suggest the workforce has been productive while logging in from home. The company reported Tuesday that it beat Wall Street expectations for the last three months of 2024 with a quarterly revenue of $554 million.

<article>Intel&#39;s Stock Jumps 18.8% - But What&#39;s In Its Future?
Intel&#39;s stock jumped nearly 19% this week. &#34;However, in the past year through Wednesday&#39;s close, Intel stock had fallen 53%,&#34; notes Investor&#39;s Business Daily:


The appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as CEO is a &#34;good start&#34; but Intel has significant challenges, Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a client note. Those challenges include delays in its server chip product line, a very competitive PC chip market, lack of a compelling AI chip offering, and over $10 billion in losses in its foundry business over the past 12 months. There is &#34;no quick fix&#34; for those issues, he said. 

&#34;There are things you can do,&#34; a Columbia business school associate professor tells the Wall Street Journal in a video interview, &#34;but it&#39;s going to be incremental, and it&#39;s going to be extremely risky... They will try to be competitive in the foundry manufacturing space,&#34; but &#34;It takes very aggressive investments.&#34; 

Meanwhile, TSMC is exploring a joint venture where they&#39;d operate Intel&#39;s factories, even pitching the idea to AMD, Nvidia, Broadcam, and Qualcomm, according to Reuters. (They add that Intel &#34;reported a 2024 net loss of $18.8 billion, its first since 1986,&#34; and talked to multiple sources &#34;familiar with&#34; talks about Intel&#39;s future).
Multiple companies have expressed interest in buying parts of Intel, but two of the four sources said the U.S. company has rejected discussions about selling its chip design house separately from the foundry division. Qualcomm has exited earlier discussions to buy all or part of Intel, according to those people and a separate source. Intel board members have backed a deal and held negotiations with TSMC, while some executives are firmly opposed, according to two sources. 

&#34;They say Lip-Bu Tan is the best hope to fix Intel — if Intel can be fixed at all,&#34; writes the Wall Street Journal:
He brings two decades of semiconductor industry experience, relationships across the sector, a startup mindset and an obsession with AI...and basketball. He also comes with tricky China business relationships, underscoring Silicon Valley&#39;s inability to sever itself from one of America&#39;s top adversaries... [Intel&#39;s] stock has lost two-thirds of its value in four short years as Intel sat out the AI boom... 
Manufacturing chips is an enormous expense that Intel can&#39;t currently sustain, say industry leaders and analysts. Former board members have called for a split-up. But a deal to sell all or part of Intel to competitors seems to be off the table for the immediate future, according to bankers. A variety of early-stage discussions with Broadcom, Qualcomm, GlobalFoundries and TSMC in recent months have failed to go anywhere, and so far seem unlikely to progress. The company has already hinted at a more likely outcome: bringing in outside financial backers, including customers who want a stake in the manufacturing business... 
Tan has likely no more than a year to turn the company around, said people close to the company. His decades of investing in startups and running companies — he founded a multinational venture firm and was CEO of chip design company Cadence Design Systems for 13 years — provide indications of how Tan will tackle this task in the early days: by cutting expenses, moving quickly and trying to turn Intel back into an engineering-first company. &#34;In areas where we are behind the competition, we need to take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog,&#34; Tan said in a note to Intel employees on Wednesday. &#34;And in areas where our progress has been slower than expected, we need to find new ways to pick up the pace....&#34; 

Many take this culture reset to also mean significant cuts at Intel, which already shed about 15,000 jobs last year. &#34;He is brave enough to adjust the workforce to the size needed for the business today,&#34; said Reed Hundt, a former Intel board member who has known Tan since the 1990s.<p></p><div>

<article>&#39;There&#39;s a Good Chance Your Kid Uses AI To Cheat&#39;
Long-time Slashdot reader theodp writes: Wall Street Journal K-12 education reporter Matt Barnum has a heads-up for parents: There&#39;s a Good Chance Your Kid Uses AI to Cheat. Barnum writes: &#34;A high-school senior from New Jersey doesn&#39;t want the world to know that she cheated her way through English, math and history classes last year. Yet her experience, which the 17-year-old told The Wall Street Journal with her parent&#39;s permission, shows how generative AI has rooted in America&#39;s education system, allowing a generation of students to outsource their schoolwork to software with access to the world&#39;s knowledge. [...] The New Jersey student told the Journal why she used AI for dozens of assignments last year: Work was boring or difficult. She wanted a better grade. A few times, she procrastinated and ran out of time to complete assignments. The student turned to OpenAI&#39;s ChatGPT and Google&#39;s Gemini, to help spawn ideas and review concepts, which many teachers allow. More often, though, AI completed her work. Gemini solved math homework problems, she said, and aced a take-home test. ChatGPT did calculations for a science lab. It produced a tricky section of a history term paper, which she rewrote to avoid detection. The student was caught only once.&#34; Not surprisingly, AI companies play up the idea that AI will radically improve learning, while educators are more skeptical. &#34;This is a gigantic public experiment that no one has asked for,&#34; said Marc Watkins, assistant director of academic innovation at the University of Mississippi.<p></p><div>
